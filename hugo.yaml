      Welcome to my stream of consciousness! ðŸ‘‹ Here you'll find my thoughts on building and scaling products that [don't just slice the pie but expand it for everyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat#Implications). 
      I also like to ramble about security, reliability, developer productivity and building autonomous teams.
