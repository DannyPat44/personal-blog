I work in the software development industry. We often have the privilege of being very iterative when solving problems because the investment cost of going back and changing something is usually very low.

How I usually look at solving a new problem is to work to try and define the problem, concentrating on what my minimum requirements are that I need to meet, what my nice to haves are, and what the limitations or constraints I face are. Once I have these defined, I can circulate them for feedback with my peers. This helps ensure I am not missing something or focussing on the wrong aspects.

Deciding what problem you are and are not trying to address is often more important than how you solve it, as concentrating on the wrong aspects can make you waste valuable resources or not accomplish what you set out to solve.

Once I am confident about the problem, I will usually look for other existing solutions that may already exist today. They often may not do exactly what I need them to do, but the techniques and approach can provide inspiration or learning that I can use to address my problem. I will use inspiration to build a hypothesis of how I can solve the problem I defined. Again, I am taking the time to document my solution and any significant tradeoffs that it may have, and I am circulating my findings with peers.

Once I have incorporated their feedback, I decide the minimum investment I can make to start building the defined solution, only addressing the requirements I defined as required. This lets me experiment and see if my solution will solve my issues before overly investing in something that may not be viable. With this feedback loop established, I can repeat this process, adding more requirements or concerns and ensuring that my solution still addresses the problem I set out to solve. If at any point I find that my solution is sufficient or additional investment is likely to outweigh returns. I can choose to pause investing further.
