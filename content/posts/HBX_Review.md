I completed the online Economics for Managers course at Harvard Business School Online from January to March. I want to share my perspective with anyone interested in a similar course.
I found the course expensive (especially once you factor in the currency exchange) given it boiled down to CBT modules. However, the pricing was roughly in line with what I found in my search for other business courses offered through traditional post-secondary schools. When you look at anything connected to a business school, they know your Willingness to Pay (WTP) is high. The League learning credit covered most of the course fee, making committing easier.
The course structure was exactly what I needed. It provided a comprehensive overview of the subject, giving me a solid foundation to explore the concepts in more depth on my own. It was a perfect jumping-off point for my further learning.
The material was not just theoretical, but also practical, making it engaging and easy to understand. The case studies were particularly helpful in illustrating the application of complex concepts in real-world scenarios. However, the community and interaction aspects of the course were lacking, making it feel more like a self-directed learning experience.
The initial module of the course was a review of fundamental concepts, which I found to be a practical application of the theoretical knowledge taught in first-year university microeconomics courses (link to the one I took in university.
In the “Strategies for Assessing and Increasing Demand” module, I found the Conjoint Analysis tools and the concept of Network effects to be the most useful. I recommend the book The Cold Start Problem if you are interested in the practical application of network effects. The “Suppliers and Cost” module was most relevant to the problems  I am grappling with at work. Particularly distinguishing between fixed and variable costs, the effect of scale economies and Relative Cost Analysis.
Regarding total time commitment, I needed around 8-10 hours a week to work through the modules and complete the quizzes. The quizzes were straightforward and only required you to engage with the material; they weren’t tough. However, I must review and apply the concepts daily to retain the information.
The next course I plan to take (the current vogue) is Fast AI Practical Deep Learning, along with Sebastian. Unfortunately, this one doesn’t have built-in due dates, so I will need to work on setting up some accountability mechanisms for committing adequate time investments.
