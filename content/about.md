I have been working as a software engineer (with a focus on security) for the last 10 years.

During that time I have secured industrial control systems in [nuclear plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Nuclear_Generating_Station), scaled [a leading telematic providers ](https://www.geotab.com/platform-overview/) security & compliance programs, and 
mostly recently have been building products to consumerize healthcare at [League](https://league.com/). 

Lately, I have been primarily focused on building systems for frictionless (and secure) customer identity and access management. A less featured version of [AWS Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-federatedidentities-api-reference.html). 

I think [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) will be a major disruptor to the industry (eventually). I am building products and exploring the surrounding ecosystem. Check back here for regular updates and general thoughts about software engineering.
